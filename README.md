## Data Science in Python 
Introduction to Data Science and the most used libraries in Python through examples. The libraries presented were born from a need in the scientific community to have a more complete suite of opensource tools instead of the commonly used proprietary software. You'll learn some history behind these libraries, where you can get the best learning resources and use them for your own projects, and how you can actively contribute.  

## DeepSpeech by Mozilla
Introduction to DeepSpeech, a TensorFlow implementation of Baidu's DeepSpeech architecture by Mozilla. We'll explore a great journey from a scientific paper to an opensource speech recognition project, and its future convergence with Common Voice. You'll get to know the fundamental Deep Learning concepts behind the library and how to use the library for the first time.
